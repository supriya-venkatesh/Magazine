HOD message

A very cheerful welcome to all the students. With the commencement of our new academic year i wish everyone all the best for the 
upcoming semester. Also, a special welcome for all the freshmen into the IIITN family. May the next four years be of growth and development of not only your career but also as a person. Along with focusing on your academics, make sure you also explore extra curricular activities. Network as much as you can. Take part in all the various activities being held across the vast college campus. You have an abundant amount of great resources at your disposal. Freely available online courses, the vast amount of articles and books available on the internet, the college library and the faculty will always be willing to help you out with your queries. Do not be afraid to learn things on your own, take up small projects and do not shy away from the obstacles you will face along the way. Encountering implementation challenges will only improve your technical and logical skills. You can always consult the professors if you wish to use the laboratories for your personal projects. Reach out to your seniors, they can give you valuable guidance and help you with your interests. Try to participate as actively as you can in TantraFiesta and Abhivyakti, our college festivals, as they are an amalgamation of various opportunities and events. Represent the college in competitive sports such as in 
inter-IIIT sports meet and Institute gathering.
For the pre-final and final year students, i wish them the best for taking the next big stride in your career. I hope you have 
explored various fields and know where the most of your individual intrests lie. Try to work with a faculty intrested in similar
areas and publish some research work. Build a strong profile and start applying for internships. Be prepared for job and internship
interviews.
